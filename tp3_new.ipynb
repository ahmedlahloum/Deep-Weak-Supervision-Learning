To achieve that, we trained three classical models: A basic Convolutional neural network, a VGG Architechture and a Resnet Architechture. The pros of this method is that we don't need any external ressources during the training. However, the lack of data makes it very hard to obtain acceptable performances. But we can see that the used architechture can help improve performances, like with the Resnet Architechture. \n",
